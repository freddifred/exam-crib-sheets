Double-sided A4 Crib Sheets for Mathematics Exams at The University of York

NOTE: These documents are intended to pack as much information as possible onto
two sides of A4, in line with the Departmental regulations on the use of crib
sheets in examinations. Thus, they may, from time to time, break standard
typographical practice in favour of practicality.

Should you wish to use these sheets for your own exploits, you ought to know
three things:

 - The resultant PDFs are not tracked in version control. Therefore, you will
   have to either (a) download and compile the documents on your own machine, or
   (b) use the ones that I have compiled and made available on-line. Option (a)
   is not particularly difficult, and they don't require any exotic packages
   that aren't on CTAN and included in every modern TeX Live distribution. If
   you'd prefer (b), see: https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~od641/exam-crib-sheets.

 - The margins and text are abnormally small, for the reasons described above.
   Some home printers (old home InkJet series and the like) might have trouble
   printing these documents correctly, so I recommend using a high-resolution
   office laser printer, such as the ones scattered throughout The University of
   York campuses.
