# Calculus Exam Notes

## General Remarks on the Calculus Exam

Past examination papers from the previous two (COVID) years have been made
available to York students, both of which took place in an open-book
environment; this is not the case for the upcoming 2022/23 Summer examination,
which will be closed-book and completed under the watchful eye of invigilators.

 * 2020/21: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=136393>
 * 2021/22: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=136394>

In both of these papers, there are nine questions: Q1--Q4 cover topics taught
during the Autumn Term, and Q5--Q9 cover topics taught during the Spring Term.
Although this is not guaranteed for the 2022/23 exam, it is reasonably likely
that this paper will take a similar form; I am linking the notes here for
convenience.

 * Autumn: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=131602>
 * Spring: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=134423>

These are topics covered by the past papers, listed by the relevant term and
corresponding chapter title found in the Notes:

1. [AUT] Differentiation and L'Hopital's Rule
2. [AUT] Taylor Series
3. [AUT] Integration
4. [AUT] First-Order ODEs
5. [SPR] Second-Order Differential Equations
6. [SPR] Fourier Series
7. [SPR] Functions of Two or More Variables
8. [SPR] Double Integrals
9. [SPR] Extrema

## Older Papers

For completeness, I am including links to older papers, from 2011 to 2019. These
are not likely to be very useful, since the course notes have changed over this
period of time. I apologise, in advance, for the monstrously long and unreadable
permalinks generated by the Library website. As usual, these are accessible
exclusively to York users with a Library/ITS account.
