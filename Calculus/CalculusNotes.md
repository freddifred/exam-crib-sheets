# Calculus Exam Notes

[INCOMPLETE; SEE TODO MARKERS]

## General Remarks on the Calculus Exam

Past examination papers from the previous two (COVID) years have been made
available to York students, both of which took place in an open-book
environment; this is not the case for the upcoming 2022/23 Summer examination,
which will be closed-book and completed under the watchful eye of invigilators.

 * 2020/21: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=136393>
 * 2021/22: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=136394>

In both of these papers, there are nine questions: Q1--Q4 cover topics taught
during the Autumn Term, and Q5--Q9 cover topics taught during the Spring Term.
Although this is not guaranteed for the 2022/23 exam, it is reasonably likely
that this paper will take a similar form; I am linking the notes here for
convenience.

 * Autumn: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=131602>
 * Spring: <https://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=134423>

These are topics covered by the past papers, listed by the relevant term and
corresponding chapter title found in the Notes:

1. [AUT] Differentiation and L'Hopital's Rule
2. [AUT] Taylor Series
3. [AUT] Integration
4. [AUT] First-Order ODEs
5. [SPR] Second-Order Differential Equations
6. [SPR] Fourier Series
7. [SPR] Functions of Two or More Variables
8. [SPR] Double Integrals
9. [SPR] Extrema

## Some Remarks on Each Question

1. This question will likely involve a L'Hopital computation as the final part;
   such a computation would typically require a commentary to justify the use of
   the L'HR: ensuring the limit is in an indeterminate form, etc. (there are
   five things to check). The section on differentiation is slightly less
   predictable, and could cover anything from a recursive invocation of the
   Chain Rule, to finding critical points, to writing a proof involving the
   Intermediate Value Theorem.

2. Judging by the past papers, it is reasonable to assume that this question
   will be relatively straight-forwards, only requiring the computation of some
   Taylor polynomial of a given function, centered at a given point. It will be
   necessary to revise most of the "Taylor's Theorem" section in the Autumn
   Notes, as there are plenty of edge-cases of which you'll need to be careful.

3. It is probable that this question will involve some sort of integration,
   which is another very large topic. In the 2020/21 paper, it was combined (in
   a rather contrived fashion) with ODEs, although there were still separate
   questions for first- and second-order differential equations. In the 2021/22
   exam, this question had two parts, both of which required invocations of the
   integration-by-parts technique, although the second part was slightly more
   involved as a preliminary substitution was also necessary. The question from
   2020/221 was much less involved, awarding two marks for a simple expression
   of a given quotient as partial fractions.

4. This question will probably concern finding the solution of a first-order
   ordinary differential equation. In the 2020/21 paper, test-takers were only
   asked to find the general solution, but the 2021/22 paper requires solving
   under some given initial boundary (for which an additional two marks were
   awarded).

5. Something involving a second-order differential equation is the likely
   candidate for this question. It is reasonably difficult to predict any
   details of this one: in the 2020/21 paper, students were asked to solve a
   very typical and routine differential equation under some given
   conditions.  The 2021/22 paper, on the other hand, was (superficially)
   more involved, requiring knowledge of oscillatory solutions. The question
   on second-order differential equations will certainly be comprised
   largely of finding the general solution and particular solution of some
   given DE.

## Older Papers

For completeness, I am including links to older papers, from 2011 to 2019. These
are not likely to be very useful, since the course notes have changed
substantially over this period of time. I apologise, in advance, for the
monstrously long and unreadable permalinks generated by the Library website. As
usual, these are accessible exclusively to York users with a Library account.
